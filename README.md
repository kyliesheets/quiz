**Reflection**

**1. Identify one problem you encountered in this unit (i.e., during the independent project, not before) and describe how you overcame it. This might be fixing a bug, implementing a feature, or understanding a new concept or skill. Include a code snippet along with your explanation.**

If I'm being honest, computer science is something I've never had experience with before so everything was really challenging, at least at the beginning. For my independent project specifically, I had a lot of problems. First of all, I made a quiz because I thought it would be easy - but boy was I wrong. I had no idea how to do javascript, and I barely even knew html, only the basics, so it was a huge struggle from the beginning. I had no idea how to accumulate the results to give one final answer in the end, and I didn't know how to navigate from one toggle/page to the next, and this whole thing was just one big problem for me. I was able to learn how to toggle from one thing to the other all on the same page thanks to Mr. Bowman though, and this is some of the code that helped me from w3 schools that was basically the whole layout for all my code: function myFunction() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myDIV");
  if (x.style.display === "none") {
    x.style.display = "block";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "none";
  }
}

**2. How has your understanding of computing changed since the beginning of the semester? Identify at least one specific piece of knowledge, concept, or attitude.**

At the beginning of the semester, I think I was way too over-confident since Mr. Bowman said that if you're good at math, then you'll most likely be good at computer science. I love math and I think I'm alright at it so I thought this class would be easey peasey, but it was quite the opposite. I came into computer science expecting it to be a breeze and to just do it so I had the option to take the AP next year if I wanted, and I left thinking wow why did I ever think computer science would be easy? Although I don't think I will take my computer science skills anywhere further, I'm still glad that I was open to new  and learning and that at least experienced and got a snippet of what computer science is, and now I know I'm probably not going to go any deeper into computer science. It was still a pretty chill and relaxing class though so I'm glad I took it.

**3. What new skills have you acquired this semester? Identify at least one thing you can do now that you could not do before taking the class.**

Well I couldn't do anything before, but now I can somewhat make websites! The easiest and my favorite thing in computer science was the multi-page website and the classic computer stan assignment. I did this because we had to use our own creativity and it was really fun doing what I wanted while still following the criteria. One thing I can do now and couldn't do earlier was to create a readme, and I also couldn't do any html. Now I know the basics of html and can create a simple multi-page website and I am happy.

**4. In what ways do computers improve our lives? Explain.**

When I think back to the days where I wasn't alive and how technology doesn't exist, for some reason I think of a really isolated and boring world. I'm sure the world was actually more peaceful without technology, but I just can't comprehend that at one point there was no way to just simply shoot your dad a text, call your friend over, go on google to look up how to bake a cake, and so much more. Although I'm sure computers can be bad in some ways such as in addiction to technology, hackers, viruses, easier access to our information, and so much more, I honestly think that they'r more beneficial than they're not. Now I don't have to flip through a cook book to find a recipe to bake a cake, look through a dictionary to find the definition of capricious, wait a few days to receive a letter back from my friend, and so many more possibilities that were impossible before computers, technology, and devices existed. I think computers have improved our life for the better and allowed us to be more open and creative and actually pursue anything we want because now we can.

**5. In what ways would our lives be improved by removing computers from our lives? Explain**

Even though technically computers connect people in the world better, I think it's took away the connection that people have from the world. Now instead of going on walks and catching fireflies at night, people would rather scroll on instagram, tik tok, or watch youtube for an hour. We get less socialization because instead of going over to our friend's house and knocking on their door, you can simply just text them or call them which creates an isolating environment for almost everyone in the world. Computers have impacted the world for the better in many ways, but I think they have also stopped us from building real connections and relationships to people, plants, the present, future, past, and so much more. No matter how many possibilites the internet has provided us with, I don't think it's anything compared to what it's taken away.

**6. Will being in this class have an impact on you in the future? In what way?**

Honestly, it probably won't have the biggest impact, but I still have so many good memories in it. My favorite parts of this class was talking to my friend before we graduated because since he was the only senior in class and I was the only girl, it's like two people who wouldn't ever form a bond but they did just because of the certain circumstances. I think this friendship was a great example of something computers has taken away from us because although we did use our computers together because obviously it's a computer class, my best memories with im was of us just talking face to face, no computers in the way. So I guess this class has made me realize all the possible bonds and relationships I'm missing out on just because of all the technology and internet that's got in my way.
